# Note Taker
## Purpose
This app will make your day go by a lot smoother, think of how much easier it would be for you to take down notes as you go on with your day without the need of carrying a note pad and pen. Just pull out your phone, go to the website/app and start noting away! You will be able to add your notes in with a title and description. You can even put in tasks so you wont forget about it before ending your day. Add as many notes or tasks as you like and delete them when you no longer need it or when the tasked is done.
